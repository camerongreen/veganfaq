        <h1>Human exceptionalism</h1>
        <p>The belief that there is an impassable divide between humankind and all other life</p>
        <p>Unquestioned assumption underlying much thought in our society</p>
        <p>Overlap with concept of <strong>speciesism</strong></p>
        <p>Part of the philosophical underpinnings of our society, which are largely ignored</p>

        <h2>Speciesism</h2>
        <p>"...a prejudice or bias in favour of the interests of members of one's own species and against those of
          members of other species" Peter Singer, Animal Liberation, 1975</p>
        <p>Has come to have a wider connotation, such as the difference in treatment between pets and farm animals</p>
        <p>For example, pigs have a greater level of intelligence than dogs.  Despite this, pigs are allowed to be kept in conditions in which it would be illegal to keep a dog.</p>
