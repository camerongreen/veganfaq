        <h2>Speciesism</h2>
        <p>"...a prejudice or bias in favour of the interests of members of one's own species and against those of
          members of other species" Peter Singer, Animal Liberation, 1975</p>
        <p>Has come to have a wider connotation, such as the difference in treatment between pets and farm animals</p>
        <p>For example, pigs have a greater level of intelligence than dogs.  Despite this, pigs are allowed to be kept in conditions in which it would be illegal to keep a dog.</p>
