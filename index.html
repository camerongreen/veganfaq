            <li>Most creatures we eat are herbivorous so we save more plants by consuming them directly.</li>
            <li>Studies show plants can respond to stimuli, however lacking a central nervous system and brain there is
              no evidence they feel pain.
            </li>
            <li>The line between plants and animals is blurry. Mussels, sea anemones, mushrooms, all sit in the
              middle. Ultimately our best scientific knowledge should be our guide here, erring on the side of
              compassion.

              people
              will change, is optimistic at best.</li>
            <li>People will feel their ethics are being attacked, which they are, and will become defensive.</li>
            <li>Thus it is important for us to remember to bring our other social skills to the table when discussing ethical considerations.</li>
